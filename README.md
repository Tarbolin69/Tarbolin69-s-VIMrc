# Tarbolin69's Amazingly Magnificent VIMrc

This is the config file I use for Vim (or Neovim, in this case) across all my workspaces. It's a fairly _normal_ config, all things considered. The amount of folders and mumbo-jumbo code in some parts may look a bit daunting, but its all mostly hands-free on the user's part.

# Plugins

I use [https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug](Vim-Plug) as my plugin manager (it's both easy to use and very minimal). You can see what plugins I use in the init.vim file.
